Testnet 3 is out, and it is incentivized
    Rewards for proposers and provers:
        To accomplish the goal of testing the new protocol economics design, alpha-3 will be an incentivized testnet towards proposers and provers.
        We need to test how permissionless proposers and provers act in a mainnet-simulated environment, where they act rationally according to the fees and rewards of the protocol.
        (Alpha-2 was incentivized only on the prover side).
        Simulating a mainnet environment with permissionless economic activity is not so simple on a testnet due to the lack of real value assets.
