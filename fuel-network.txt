Fuel has a Guild now:
    https://guild.xyz/fuel
    Requirements are 0.001 ETH, Captcha, and Discord older than 6 months
    Twitter is not verifying because of API issues, so no extra Discord roles

Hackathon announced, based on Sway language
    Would like to participate, but don't want to get too deep into Sway
    Check out doing something mostly in React, with somebody else doing the Sway
